 * @brief Class that provides basic abstraction over socket communcation.
 *        It holds information about the other device such as
 *        its address and its remote port, and also the local socket
 *        file descriptor. This class also provides methods to
 *        send and receive information through the socket.
 *
 *        This is a pure virtual class so it can't be instantiated.
 *        Instead, use one of its subclasses (TCPSocket and UDPSocket).
